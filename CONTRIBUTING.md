# Contributing to xcp.dev

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 

To maintain the quality and consistency of the codebase, we have set up the following guidelines for contributions:

## Branching and Pull Requests

1. **Creating Branches:**
    - Please create your own branches from `develop` for any new features, fixes, or improvements.
    - Name your branches in a way that reflects the purpose of the changes you're making.

2. **Making Changes:**
    - Commit your changes to your branch.

3. **Pull Requests:**
    - Once you are done with your changes, create a pull request to merge your branch into `develop`.
    - Provide a clear description in your pull request about what your changes entail and why they are necessary.

## Restrictions

- **No Direct Pushes to `main`:**
    - To ensure the stability and quality of the main codebase, direct pushes to the `main` branch are not allowed.
    - All changes must go through the pull request process and be merged into `develop` first.
